        <div> Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games,<br>
            read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside<br>
             and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time;<br>
            some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. <br>
            Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my <br>
            cousin in the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare<br>
            hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am taller than <br>
            most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons<br>
             that I take during summer time</div>
