    <div> <p>Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games,<br>
        read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside<br>
         and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time;<br>
        some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. <br>
        Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my <br>
        cousin in the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare<br>
        hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am taller than <br>
        most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons<br>
         that I take during summer time </p></div>
